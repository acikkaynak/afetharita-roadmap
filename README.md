# Afet Harita Roadmap

## Statement

In the aftermath of the earthquake in Turkey, there was no sophisticated emergency response system to turn to. Every moment counted as lives were on the line. But from this tragedy rose a movement of 20,000 contributors, determined to give a voice to the victims. The result was the Afet Harita Mapping Application, a cutting-edge open-source platform available for all. Our objective is to ensure that Afet Harita becomes the gold standard in disaster response, providing a crucial lifeline to those in need. Natural disasters may strike again, but our mission is to make sure that humanity is always ready to respond, in the name of those we have lost.

## What is Afet Harita
Afet Harita is a tool designed as a open-source project to help emergency responders quickly identify areas affected by natural distasters and locate potential victims. Food locations, hospitals and other available services can be found in this application. The goal of this roadmap is to outline the development plan for Afet Harita, including the features and milestones that will be achieved over time.
