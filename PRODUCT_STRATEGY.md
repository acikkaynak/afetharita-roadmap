## Risks and Mitigation Strategies 
> This section outlines the risks associated with the product strategy and the strategies in place to mitigate those risks.

In the case of Afet Harita, a community-driven open source emergency response application, there are several key risks that need to be considered and addressed. Some of these risks include:

### Political pressures
Afet Harita operates in the disaster response and relief space, which is heavily influenced by political forces. There may be political pressures to alter or censor information that is being shared on the platform, or to restrict access to certain communities.

### Collaboration with civil society organizations
Afet Harita aims to facilitate communication and collaboration between relief organizations and affected communities. However, there may be challenges in engaging with these organizations, as they may have different priorities and goals.

### Data resources
Access to real-time information is crucial for effective disaster response and recovery efforts. There may be challenges in accessing relevant data resources, such as social media platforms, that could impact the accuracy and timeliness of information being shared on Afet Harita.

### Community ownership
As a community-driven initiative, Afet Harita relies on the engagement and contributions of its users to drive its development and success. There may be challenges in maintaining the ownership and direction of the platform, particularly if key contributors move on or lose interest.
To mitigate these risks, Afet Harita will need to have clear and effective strategies in place. These may include:
1. Building strong partnerships with relevant organizations and stakeholders to ensure that the platform aligns with their priorities and goals.
2. Engaging with communities and users to understand their needs and preferences, and to ensure that the platform is relevant and useful to them.
3. Ensuring that the platform is transparent and secure, and that data privacy is a top priority.
4. Encouraging contributions and engagement from the community, and providing incentives and recognition for key contributors.
5. Building a robust and flexible technology infrastructure that is resilient to disruptions and can quickly adapt to changing circumstances.

By addressing these risks and implementing effective mitigation strategies, Afet Harita can increase its chances of success and become an indispensable tool for disaster response and recovery efforts.
