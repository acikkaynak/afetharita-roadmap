To Do List:
* Eray, Umut and Emre Savci are extremly focused on technical side currently. Instead of reaching out them for any advisory info, only crystal clear info should be the reason to reach out to them.
  * Action for All Product Managers
* There is a form in https://depremyardim.com/. We are not sure if the data coming from depremyardim is getting implemented to AfetHarita.
* Provision Aid and Confirmed data were used to come for 3 days cycles. It seems this process has been cancelled. Must be confirmed with Frontend Team.
* Figma link should be included in onboarding docs. 
  * Action for Hande 
* Product Manager Shift schedule should be established. There is always a problem with finding available PM.
  * Managers must be providing offline/online information. Critical information must be published within the core channel with other managers.
  * We should prepare a post in the core team and pin this information.
* Must be prepared a list of team lead contact for emergency reach out.
* We need to determine how we will move forward with displaying data information details.
  * [Figma Link](https://www.figma.com/file/sctw6xtcdoFOfmE0gC97Ft/Afetharita.com?node-id=2349%3A8093&t=eijfmGXz5YKZos8G-0)
  * There is a confusion with confirmed option. This feature will help users to understand where the data is coming from.
  * If we release this feature, we must provide the source details. This includes where the data comes from etc. Also this should be confirmed with Legal team.
